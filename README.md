# Folder Renamer Script

This Python script automatically renames folders by removing any text within square brackets in the folder names. It's particularly useful for cleaning up folder names in bulk, especially those downloaded from various sources that include metadata in square brackets.

## Features

- **Bulk Renaming:** Rename multiple folders in one go.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Automatically resolves name conflicts by appending a unique number to the folder names.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Operating system: Windows, Linux, or macOS

## Usage

1. Place the `renamer.py` script in the root directory containing the folders you wish to rename.
2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python renamer.py
